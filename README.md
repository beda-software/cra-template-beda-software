# cra-template-beda-software

This is the unofficial TypeScript template for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To use this template, run `yarn create react-app frontend --template git+https://github.com/beda-software/cra-template-beda-software.git` when creating a new app, where `frontend` is a target directory.

After that:
* Go to the `frontend` directory.
* Initialize git repository with `git init` command.
* Add "aidbox-react submodule" with `git submodule add https://github.com/beda-software/aidbox-react src/embed/aidbox-react`.
* Run server with `yarn start`.
